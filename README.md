This app is the first functionality of a bigger plan.

The plan is to allow permacultor to have a good vision of what is going on in their garden. Culture management, resources management, data analysis.

The first functionality is to create a "virtual garden" : add cultures, add lot of plants within cultures, follow the evolution of each lot in time.
